## WTF is PledgePost?

### Description
PledgePost is a platform where writers can publish their articles, collect donations, and receive extra funds based on those donations through Quadratic Funding (QF). QF is a unique model designed to allocate funds based on both the number of contributors and the amounts they contribute. Unlike traditional funding models where every contribution is valued equally, QF amplifies the influence of each individual donation, fostering broader participation.

### Objective: 
We envision a world where contributions to collective intelligence, a vital public good, are duly rewarded. PledgePost's primary objective is not only to promote open knowledge-sharing but also to ensure it's incentivized and esteemed. Our platform ensures writers are fairly compensated for their pivotal role in enriching our collective intelligence.
